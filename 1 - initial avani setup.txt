`sudo apt install -y lirc`

add the following 2 lines to /boot/firmware/config.txt with `sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt`

edit `/etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf` with `sudo nano /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf` to have the following lines: 

```
driver          = default
device          = auto
```

the above is different from what the github says: github says instead of putting auto, to use the transmitter or receiver. 
but... at least after I've already defined the remote, auto works perfectly.
maybe I would need to manually set it to the receiver if reading in a new remote.


```
dtoverlay=gpio-ir,gpio_pin=18
dtoverlay=gpio-ir-tx,gpio_pin=17
```

reboot
`sudo reboot`

You've already done the work to setup the remotes data.

back up the original: 
`sudo mv /etc/lirc/lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd-backup.conf`

copy over the one you configured:
`sudo cp ./combined.lircd.conf.txt /etc/lirc/lircd.conf`


kick off the service.
`sudo systemctl restart lircd`
