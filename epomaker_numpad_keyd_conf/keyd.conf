# this is for keyd keyboard remapping service

# installation:copied straight from the github
# `git clone https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd`
# `cd keyd`
# `make && sudo make install`
# `sudo systemctl enable keyd && sudo systemctl start keyd`

# taking this config file and loading  it into keyd: 
# assuming you're  in the directory containing this file you're reading:
# cp file over and reload with: `sudo cp ./epomaker_numpad_keyd_conf/keyd.conf /etc/keyd/default.conf && sudo keyd reload`
# verify with `keyd monitor`

[ids]

# this is the vendor id and product id of the specific keyboard I want keyd to be modifying
# if you want global configurations, use * instead of listing a specific hardware id like I did.
# id of keyboard found with `keyd monitor`, which gave me the output: 
# device added: 320f:5088:e44ee79b Telink Wireless Gaming Keyboard (/dev/input/event18)
# more information found in documentation with `man keyd`

[main]

#    from the code, what the mappings are.
