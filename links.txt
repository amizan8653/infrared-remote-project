how to get keyboard inputs to be read on python: 
https://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-detect-keyboard-and-mouse-inputs-on-a-raspberry-pi/

how to go and get services setup can be found in boot.pdf in section 4.4.4. It's all about serviced

out of the many things I tried to go and remap keyboard keys, this is the one that worked and had really good documentation and checked all the boxes for me
keyd:
https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd

instruction on repo are very thorough

installation:
git clone https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd
cd keyd
make && sudo make install
sudo systemctl enable keyd && sudo systemctl start keyd

finding out what keys are pressed
keyd monitor
>> gives you the following output:

you can also find all the stuff that you can choose to remap to 
keyd list-keys
Unfortunately pygame doesn't recognize all... it was trial and error finding the ones that do.

I think that I'll go and make this the config file for keyd:

```/etc/keyd/default.conf
# this is for keyd keyboard remapping service

# installation:copied straight from the github
# `git clone https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd`
# `cd keyd`
# `make && sudo make install`
# `sudo systemctl enable keyd && sudo systemctl start keyd`

# taking this config file and loading  it into keyd: 
# assuming you're  in the directory containing this file you're reading:
# cp file over and reload with: `sudo cp ./keyd.conf /etc/keyd/default.conf && sudo keyd reload`
# verify with `keyd monitor`

[ids]

# this is the vendor id and product id of the specific keyboard I want keyd to be modifying
# if you want global configurations, use * instead of listing a specific hardware id like I did.
# id of keyboard found with `keyd monitor`, which gave me the output: 
# device added: 2222:0064:c70558c2 Macally Bluetooth BTNUMKEY Keypad Keyboard (/dev/input/event5)
# more information found in documentation with `man keyd`

2222:0064

[main]

# in terms of valid options to remap to, I found keys by using command `keyd list-keys` and picked key that weren't on my main keyboard like f14-f24
# in terms of what the bluetooth numpad keycodes are such as "kp9" & etc, that was found with command `keyd monitor` and pressing keys
