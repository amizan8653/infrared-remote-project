there's been jank with the pyhthon version - sometimes buttons don't respond to me and also if the program crashes, it won't auto restart as a service
so far all the remote IR commands are done via terminal, and so are the DDCUTIL commands. pywiz was the only python library.

we can replace it now:

this reddit post explains it:

and that links to this website:

which generates some example commands 

On raspberry pi you can install netcat to go and run the commands. Install with
`sudo apt install netcat-openbsd`

After that, if the IP address of a bulb is for example `192.168.4.21`, then you can turn it on with 
echo -n "{\"id\":1,\"method\":\"setState\",\"params\":{\"state\":true}}" | nc -u -w 1 192.168.4.21 38899
and off with 
echo -n "{\"id\":1,\"method\":\"setState\",\"params\":{\"state\":false}}" | nc -u -w 1 192.168.4.21 38899

still need to go and figure out how to set RGB but that shouldn't be too bad.
