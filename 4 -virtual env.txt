for lirc and the infrared stuff, no additional python libraries are needed. 

But then when we want to do stuff with wiz lights, we need pip install pywizlight for example.

this requires a virutal env as raspberry pi doesn't  really let us fuck with the gobal python libraries as we'd probably break stuff.
I mean we _could_ run a special command to let us install whatever and potentially break stuff.
but I'd rather not.

So, setup a virtual env in home directory which also has access to all the system wide stuff in it too with

```
python -m venv ~/.venv --system-site-packages
```

next, when .bashrc kicks off new terminal windows, you'll want to source the virtual env.
Add thish to  your .bashrc at the very end:

```
source ~/.venv/bin/activate
```

close terminal and open up another one to verify that we are in the virtual env. then go and run this: 

```
pip install pywizlight
```
