basiaclly... I enabled hdmi CEC on my monitor (probably disabled cause you're expected to use gaming intelligence app)

You HAVE to connect directly to the monitor - no hub or switch or matrx. 

Initially used this with display port hooked up to my monitor and hdmi cec off. and a 2nd display. this way I could view what VCP code was for input and all the values. 
Also found the one for volume as well.

VCP codes for switching inputs on MSI monitor: 
60 -> 15 Display Port
60 -> 17 HDMI 1
60 -> 18 HDMI 2

volume controled at VCP code 60 and has max value of 100. 

anyways, linux utility: 

# install: 
sudo apt-get install ddcutil

# detect monitors: 
sudo ddcutil detect

# output if you're connected to a HUB (and maybe if you're connected via HDMI and have HDMI CEC turned off):

```
