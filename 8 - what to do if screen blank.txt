note: I did some code changes that ended up causing my screen to be blank when the pi booted up.

If you want to "recover" from this, you need to get terminal access

To get into terminal, you can just do ctrl + alt + f1

From there navigate to your git repo and  do a `git stash` followed by a `reboot`

Should be able to fix you gui by doing that.
